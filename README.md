# Practice Repository: MERN Stack & Modern Frontend

This repository is dedicated to **hands-on practice** and **exploration** of modern web development technologies, focusing primarily on the **MERN stack** and **React ecosystem**. It includes modular code examples and isolated experiments for backend and frontend tools commonly used in full-stack development.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Practiced

### 📦 Backend

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for server-side scripting
- **Express.js** – Lightweight web framework for building APIs
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for data persistence
- **Mongoose** – ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
- **Multer** – Middleware for handling file uploads
- **Controller & Model Structure** – MVC-style folder structure
- **REST API Routes** – GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations

### 🧠 Frontend

- **React.js** – Component-based UI library
- **React Router DOM** – For client-side routing and navigation
- **Redux / Redux Toolkit** – For centralized state management
- **Axios / Fetch** – API communication and data handling
- **Reusable Components** – Practicing component architecture
- **Hooks** – useState, useEffect, custom hooks, etc.

## 🧪 Topics Covered So Far

### ✅ Backend
- Creating RESTful APIs
- Connecting MongoDB with Mongoose
- Uploading images/files using Multer
- Separating concerns via controllers and models
- Handling async/await and error middleware

### ✅ Frontend
- Setting up React projects using Vite and CRA
- Routing with `react-router-dom`
- Global state management using Redux Toolkit
- Working with forms and controlled components
- API integration using Axios and Fetch
- Basic styling with Tailwind CSS (optional)

## 📚 Notes & Learning Logs

> I’m using this repo to track my learning, solve small tasks, and explore individual concepts instead of building full apps.

Some folders may contain:
- Code snippets
- Mini-projects (like Todo, Login, CRUD)
- Feature demos (like file upload preview, protected routes)
